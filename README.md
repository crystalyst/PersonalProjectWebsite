# PersonalProjectWebsite
<strong>A website to list personal projects</strong>

(Updated Jan 2020)
I created <i>http://www.columbia.edu/~jy2908/</i> to list the personal projects I am working on along with my academics. 

- Special Feature of the website:
1. This website is a scroll-website, so it only consists of one page - index.html
2. This website has a menu bar on the right side to show the location that a visitor is currently looking at - only available on desktop version
3. This website has the scroll button on the bottom to go back to the top side of it.

- Feature I am working on:
1. A database to store responses using the contact tab
2. Pages to store detailed information on projects by the time a user click on each project
