                        <h2>About the Project</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>This project, "The School on the Borders" was selected and funded by Davis Projects for Peace in 2020, and it is currently in process (delayed due to COVID-19). You can find the published project proposal at <a href="https://www.davisprojectsforpeace.org/international/projects/2020/node/10081" target="_blank">Davis Project Website</a>, and the full report will be updated by Summer 2022.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>The 14th Dalai Lama said that peace can only last where human rights are respected, where people are fed, and where individuals and nations are free. Johan Gultung, Norwegian peace scholar, said that peace means the absence of violence and should be the goal of the society. These two definitions align with the way I define peace; the society can achieve peace when there is no violence and people are well educated and respected.</p>
                        <p>In that regard, my project, “The School on the Borders,” has two goals to achieve. First, the project aims to demonstrate the possibility of sustainable peace to people in Moyale, the city located on the border of Kenya and Ethiopia. Second, the project aims to provide educational opportunities and resources that benefit the youth in the long run, which I believe essential for the sustainable peace.</p>
                        <p>I came up with the idea, starting a summer school program in Moyale, Kenya, after I had some conversations with my friend who have worked as a student volunteer in Kenya. As she shared some of her experiences of witnessing chaotic circumstances in some cities in Kenya, including Moyale, I decided to begin research on my own, to understand the situation. </p>
                        <p>Then, the more I found out, the more I want to tackle the struggles that people of Moyale have been going through. As a person who work hard for my own dream and a person who sometimes take the privileges being able to study and do whatever I want for granted, I felt that I would like to contribute to the community of Moyale in some ways, to help them being able to dream their future without worrying about violence.</p>
